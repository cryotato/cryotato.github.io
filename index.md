<!--
to-do:
- move commission status: open to index instead of having it in the header, maybe finish describing details of commissions
- make header and author profile sticky but hides when you scroll down and comes back up when you scroll up.
- scrobbles widget "playing now" or last played song or current "obsession" on the right sidebar of index page.
- make lamby my neihboure
- shrine -- PIU, what else?
- kaomojis n kaomoglish translator, kaomoglish dictionary
- RYM stats and reviews page?? and goodreads too? currently reading?
- figure out SEO stuff in docs
- maybe fix the structure of how the pages are managed in general? so in experience and lapses can be intertwined with each tag having its own page? 
- language changing button?
- it woudle be cool if the first letter of each of my writings started with a big fancy letter of this font https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/240702/saint
