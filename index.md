hi ( •ω•ฅ）.｡.:*♡ ïm Ryan / 淼子尘[^1]. everyϑiŋ ï do iꝬ to declare my identity ⅋ut ï døn't really have on̅e. ï aspire to be a [Concept](https://cryotato.github.io/blog/). ïm a schizor𖹭mantic iṋ ϑat way. 

[^1]: ϑis iꝬ a deterritorialized pun of my legal Chinese name. it translates roughly to "abyssal dustling". ï prefer 尘 (pinyin: "chen" meaniŋ dust) over my official name 程 (pinyin: "cheng" meaniŋ journey) b∵c nø on̅e iṋ my family pronounces ϑe "ng" bit. ϑe "ch" iṋ pinyin iꝬ pronounced a lot môre like "tz" as well. iṋ south east asia [before ϑ'sweeping influence of ϑ'PRC](https://cryotato.github.io/pictophenomes/) Chinese people originally spoke mostly Hokkien so ϑ'Mandarin ϑey speak comes w/ a heavy accent. ϑis iꝬ ϑ'only flavour of Chinese ï am practically familiar with, & so w̃ my Chinese name is pronounced "properly" by ϑ'book it døesn't really sound right to me eiϑer. ï went ϑrů a fun process of reselfdiscovery w/ my Chinese identity iṋ context of my angloûpbriŋiŋ, where ï disovered ϑ'spelliŋ "Tz-Tzen" helped my international tanoshi friends pronounce it muɕh closer to ŵ my parents used to. itꝬ pronounced like ϑ'middle of ca***ts 'n'*** dogs. my surname (anglosized as "Leo" here) iꝬ Liau (廖) like meow,. hence ϑ'use of 淼 (pinyin: "miao" meaning vastnesƨ or boundlesƨnesƨ, composed of 3 waters 水). ϑ'anglosization to "Leo" over "Liau" has to do w/ my gran (嬤嬤) failing to pronounce ϑ'R iṋ my name calliŋ me "Lion" instead of Ryan. Lion Meow like ϑ'Zedong. ʃhe makes ã effort.
