我是淼子尘。我所做の一切，皆ゐ定義自我，但我其實冇一个固定の身份。我渴求成ゐ一个[概念](https://cryotato.github.io/blog/)_從這點來說，我是一名分裂性浪漫者。我來自處處，や來自無處。屏息以待吧，因ゐ我會消散於無形！我就是一場短路！！

<!--
to-do:
- change mail header into a logo
- move commission status: open to index instead of having it in the header, maybe finish describing details of commissions
- fix up in experience page, add thumbnails, remove unwanted breaks in between pictures., autoplay youtube video muted. at HD, maybe dont use youtube embed
- make header and author profile sticky but hides when you scroll down and comes back up when you scroll up.
- scrobbles widget "playing now" or last played song or current "obsession" on the right sidebar of index page.
- make lamby my neihboure
- shrine -- PIU, what else?
- kaomojis n kaomoglish translator, kaomoglish dictionary
- RYM stats and reviews page?? and goodreads too? currently reading?
- figure out SEO stuff in docs
- maybe fix the structure of how the pages are managed in general? so in experience and lapses can be intertwined with each tag having its own page? 
- language changing button?
