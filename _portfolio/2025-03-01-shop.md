# The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

# The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

# Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

# Hexaphonics?
A single guitar unfolds into 6 - an orchestra. String peaks themselves become living knobs, allowing for vast unprecedented sonique-freedom

> hexaphonic /ˌhɛksəˈfɒnɪk/ (adjective)
>(of sound reproduction) In six channels.

## Impliques & possibilities
### Artificial Resonance
Reconstruct strings together, for one to digitally ignite effects on another. Play god and wire your guitars sympathetic nervous system. Make it meow. :3
### Landscape Architecture
Pan and explode the each string outwards to its own coordinates within stereo-space. Strategize constructed confields[^1]. Hyper-Spatialization.
### Pseudo-12-Stringification
Pitch-bend per-string for instant microtonal detunings, or stacked octaves and harmonies for infinite-string density. Forge new instruments from light.

# Emergent phenomena
You open the door, to another door, to another door.[^2] In this unexplored territory, machines are weaponized against familiarity.

> [emergence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergence) /ɪˈmɜː.dʒəns/ (noun)

> the development of particular patterns, properties, or behaviours in parts of complex systems that happen only when the parts of the system interact, and that the parts do not have on their own.

## Emergent distortion

*   Total eclipse - Above :: With rays directly overhead, shadows harden and vibrations slam against sensor thresholds. The signal is clipped - decapitated into synthetic limit-cased square-wave screaming.
*   Partial eclipse - Displacement :: Offset rays to graze the string-shadow from the Total to surgically target micro-variations. 
*   First contact - beyond the Periphery :: Stray far enough & rays shine unobstructed, skimming the string’s oscillating perimeter. Silence reigns, punctured only by violent strums breaching the sensor field.


## Emergent phasing

*   Full moon - Sub-String :: Light scatters from a second sun on the underside. String presence gates photon return, & so the string-shadow binary is flipped. Compared to the overexposed readings from the sun, a cleaner wave can be extracted from the secondary reflections of the moon.
*   Moonlight Eclipse cancellation :: Binary opposition is hardwired. Signals are intrinsically phase-opposed by nature. Polarity itself becomes the signal, blending & folding themselves onto each other

above : blocked : zero.

below : reflected : one.


*   Phase Diversity :: Dual-Point Capture :: One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity, blending two tones together

## Emergent compression
*   Loudness -> Dimness - Preservation :: Amplitude spikes trigger systemic dampening modulated at its source. A new and completely unique method of downwards compression, not by algorithm, but by using analogue audio-visual feedback. Everything is a reference to itself.
*   Breathing - Pulsation :: Flashy! --> the visuality of the system policing its own intensity levels allows the mechanism itself to be immediately understood. Seeing is believing. 

<!-- ## Emergent rhythm
*   MIDI/CV Injected gating :: External clock signals interrupt laser emitters, inter-process sidechaining - imposed rhythm.
- MIDI Dejected Symphony :: Pitch detection turns the Hex into a moderator of MIDI chaos for external synths to feed. -->

## Emergent Rhythm and Tremolo
- Injected Gating :: With external MIDI/CV clock signals, you can gate the laser to flash off when interrupted, creating inter-process sidechaining - imposed rhythm.
- Whammy Morph :: Aside from physically shoving the lasers (and in extension, the waveform) back and forth, when pulsed/flashed at sub-audio rates (e.g., 1-20 Hz), it will create an intrinsic tremolo or rhythmic slicing effect

## Emergent Synthesis
- Luminoscillator :: Pulse the lasers all the way to audio-rate frequencies and the Hex transcends its role as a pickup and becomes a raw synthesizer. Each laser/sensor pair transforms into an independent oscillator, its rapid on/off cycle interpreted by the sensor as a fundamental frequency.

## Emergent Ring Modulator
- Sideband Spectres :: As the emergent synth plays, the vibrating string then acts as a modulator, its signal imprinting itself onto this light-born frequency. This is Amplitude Modulation (AM) synthesis realized through physical interaction. This adds a host of sideband frequencies to the already layered signal – new spectral artifacts born from the sum and difference of the string and laser frequencies. This process forges intensely rich, often metallic, bell-like, or uniquely non-harmonic timbres.

<!--
this opens up various possible ways to control this new synth. maybe a midi keyboard could play the notes of the keyboards frequencies? or you could use a knob to slowly crank it up creating a transition between a rhythm getting faster to a tone, before playing it.
and would one knob control all of strings? or should there be one frequency knob per string?
and what are the implications of this for the existing PWM thing? isnt PWM dimming basically shaping a squarewave?

also you could do a feedback loop, you could have it oscilate at the frequency it detects the string is playing. if you do that you might be stuck with annoying tones, but you could make them have a set length so theyre more plucky like sounds\

its basically a ring modulator, if theres only one laser per string the effect is basically always 100% on? unless the reflective laser is there as well and its not flashing/modulating? then the wetness can be adjusted that way? or you can just make it so that instead of flashing all the way off and all the way on, it can flash 100% on and then 30% off to control the dryness?

How it Acts Like a Ring Modulator:
Core Principle of Ring Modulation: A ring modulator takes two input signals (let's call them Carrier and Modulator) and outputs only the sum and difference of their frequencies (Carrier + Modulator and |Carrier - Modulator|). Crucially, the original Carrier and Modulator frequencies are (ideally) suppressed in the output. This is achieved by effectively multiplying the two signals.
KitterChord Hex Scenario:
Signal 1 (The "Carrier" or one input): The audio-rate signal generated by the flashing laser. If your laser is flashing at 200 Hz, the sensor picks this up as a 200 Hz signal.
Signal 2 (The "Modulator" or other input): The audio-rate signal from the vibrating string. If your string is vibrating at 300 Hz, its movement modulates the amount of the 200 Hz laser light reaching the sensor.
The "Multiplication": The string's vibration effectively multiplies the intensity of the laser's pulsed light. When the string allows more light, the 200 Hz pulses are stronger; when it blocks light, they are weaker. This rapid variation is akin to multiplying the two signals.
Output: The sensor will then output a complex signal primarily containing the sum and difference frequencies:
200 Hz + 300 Hz = 500 Hz
|200 Hz - 300 Hz| = 100 Hz
Suppression of Originals:
The "pure" 200 Hz from the laser might still be somewhat present if the string isn't perfectly modulating it to zero at times, or if there's some "bleed."
The "pure" 300 Hz from the string (as if the laser was constantly on) is also being "overwritten" by this interaction.
The overall effect is very close to ring modulation, especially in terms of the characteristic inharmonic, metallic, or bell-like tones produced.

talk to tom about this!! he could have great advice and insights plus you need to get an update on that internship thing.. and look really smart doing it

# What if we formed a Body without Organs? (˶•˶˶•˶)
Everything is a reference to itself. All these emergent phenomena interact with each other creating something completely new all together in unpredictable ways, even just among ones I have discovered and described here. Just to bring up one example, between emergent phasing and ring modulation, while the phased reflected laser can be used to effectively to bring back the dry signal into the chaos of the ring modulation, when it does, the out-of-phase components of the signals effectively subtract when summed at the sensor, leading to complex phase interactions between the sidebands of the ring modulation and the harmonics of the clean string signal. In emergent synth terms, this can be understood as another layer of subtractive synthesis on top of the AM synthesis.
