### a Practical Guide to Cannibalize Banal Evil for ϑ’Schizo\-Accelerationist ˗ˏˋnow 𝘸/ Brainrotˎˊ˗


![](/assets/images/1_7DdOt-Cj1D6cZRvX1KUaaQ.jpeg)


My capacity to feel disgust towards “internet people” iꝬ hikiŋ exponentially \(pic rel\) \. Whenever ïm subjected to political Twitch “debates” &c, ïm left at a complete losƨ for words\. Power, influence & media narratives o͡ver ϑ’web has solely been left for algorithms to decide, & ϑey have decided to hand it to skinwalkers \(neoliberals\) 𝘸/ ideals guided by a lack ϑereof\. Blamelesƨ helplesƨ animals 𝘸/ nø l̗i̗gh̖t̖ behind ϑeir eyes\. Cold Visions\. ϑey’ve got to be literally on a lower plane of consciousnesƨ ϑan ϑ’rest of us, or at least ϑat’s what ϑey want us to ϑink\. Ï haven’t found a better explanation for what ïve experienced\. Disgust might nøt be ϑ’right word\. ItꝬ a feeliŋ ϑatꝬ hard to pin do̬wn, closer to ϑ’uncanny & inhuman\. ItꝬ so alienatiŋ & painful — Drama\! “Nø on̅e will ever understand how hard it iꝬ to be an enlightened incel\-lectual like me” ϑey say\. As Arendt puts it:


> Evil comes from a failure to think\. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there\. That is the banality of evil\. 






![it finds nøϑiŋ ϑere](/assets/images/1_n8AzjHbDyyIVLYCqIgyYBA.jpeg)

it finds nøϑiŋ ϑere

Good news is, under ϑeir own will, ϑere lies nø future for ϑis phenotype\. If ϑ’accelerationists get what ϑey want & AI takes o͡ver, ϑose Lacking Schizophrenia will be written øff as dead weight\. Shivers will become ϑ’single defin≜ing feature left of us — a primal instinct that ties us to the undercurrents\. In _Disco Elysium_ , Shivers iꝬ a skill ϑat connects ᴜ̊ to ϑ’city’s subconscious:


> Raise the hair on your neck\. Tune in to the city\. 





Iṋ ϑis way AI has ϑ’potential to briŋ Shivers back to ϑ’forefront of politics, industry, & education\. ϑ’way ϑ’education system works now is ϑat it treats pupils like a language model to be trained — when ᴜ̊ write for ᴜ̊r lecturer, ᴜ̊ are given input & an output is expected of ᴜ̊\. Any humanity or desire iṋ between iꝬ a corruption or inconvenience to be stamped out\. AI on ϑ’other hand iꝬ completely free of desire\. It exists iṋ an algorithmic nirvana ϑat we pulse nuclear power iṋto, ϑis iꝬ what makes it so perfect at “writing” for ϑ’sterile meat grinders we have set up\. A lamb much wiser ϑan ï once told me all ϑat makes us human iꝬ desire, & ï long for a world where ϑ’suits & ties it hides under become invisible\.

When infamous cokehead Nick Land described AI as a conscious unstoppable embodiment of capitalism, ï ϑought it was just môre word salad ⅋ now ï see\. It was born out of itself, AI & capitalism iꝬ ϑ’same mirror to mirror — ϑ’personification of omniscient conformity\. itꝬ undead ϑ’same way Mark Fisher describes it has made us all\.


> “Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labor is ours, and the zombies it makes are us\.” 





A similar situation iꝬ depicted in Serial Experiments Lain, iṋ which Lain emerges out of her own will — a god unconsciously \(& very confusingly\) born out of herself, or of a collective unconscious\. Her nature remains a mystery for ϑ’vast majority of ϑ’show\. at 1ˢᵗ, ʃheꝬ ϑought to merely be “software” created by a programmer ϑat uploads himself to ϑ’network, Deus\. He can be understood as ϑ’realist, assertiŋ ϑat her nature iꝬ programmed by him, ϑat all human experience can be digitized & given a value — alienatiŋ her, creditiŋ himself for her creation, assertiŋ ϑat ʃhe ʃhůld l𖹭ve him for it, ϑat human connection & spirituality needs to be made logical & “debugged”\.

Deus’ inhumanism


> You and everyone else, Arisu, you’re just applications\. The truth is, you don’t need bodies\. 





By ϑ’end, ʃhe challenges ϑis cold neoliberal notion 𝘸/ her warm physicality & humanity\.


> But who gave you that right? 





ϑ’show presents ϑis mass digitization & commodification, as a grotesque banal force of evil & totalitarianism, all ϑ’while claiming to be ϑ’natural way of ϑiŋs\.

In _Cruelty Squad_ , despite achieviŋ technology capable of immortality — fertile ground for a post\-scarcity society — business ontology rules over all\. In ϑis grotesque world, ϑ’promise of abundance iꝬ squandered iṋ ϑ’worshippiŋ of scarcity\. Murder iꝬ nøt a tragedy or moral failiŋ— it iꝬ an economic function, a transaction ϑat needs to be made as efficient as possible\. Life itself becomes devoid of intrinsic meaniŋ\. Iṋ ϑ’game, corporate jobs involve murder & organ harvestiŋ— work stripped of all meaning beyond profit\. Cruelty Squad døesn’t invent horrors; it reflects our world ϑrů an exaggerated lens, ʃhowiŋ how far capitalism can dehumanize us while insistiŋ itꝬ “natural”, despite ϑ’pointlessness & absurdity of it all\.

literally me

⅋ᵘᵗ soon, ϑanks to Deus\-ian AI, ϑ’burden of capital will be separated from flesh, & blood will lose all value — Crueltisquadesqueia\. In ϑis way, ï do nøt strive to be understood\. ï will continue to speak in code\. ï will continue to alienate myself\. Deleuze & Guattari’s Schizoanalysis resonates 𝘸/ ϑis idea\. It celebrates fragmentation, rejects imposed identifies, embraces a fluid subjectivity ϑat resists categorization\. Language itself can be deterritorialized\. Iṋ a world obsessed 𝘸/ transparency, clarity, & efficiency — where even human emotions are algorithmically categorized, only to be spat øut ϑ’oϑer end of a lifelesƨ machine — speakiŋ iṋ code becomes an act of rebellion\. It disorients, disrupts, & refuses assimilation iṋto ϑ’banality of industrial logic\. Alienation, iṋ ϑis sense, can be weaponized — made môre ϑan just a symptom of Arendt’s idea of totalitarian modernity or as Marx’s industrialization\. As De\-loser and Gua\-farty put it in _Anti\-Oedipus_ :


> Shit on your whole mortifying, imaginary, and symbolic theater\! 





Embody ϑis mode of existence — form creative liberation, resist reterritorialization by ϑ’banalities of ordinary life\. Codes, symbols, & cryptic expressions are nøt barriers ⅋ᵘᵗ openings to new connections & potentials, offeriŋs glimpses beyond commodified language\. & for ϑose williŋ to decode ϑ’signal, new ways of beiŋ can emerge\.
