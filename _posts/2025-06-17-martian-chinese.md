我
i like using 窝/窩 in place of 我 (meaning I or me) b∵c it lꙭks more like a person. w/ ϑ'simplified 窝 it lꙭks like a face with a ૮ ,◕ ﻌ ◕ა-type nose and a mustache.
ϑ'traditional character 窩 can be used to express discontent ϑa̍ňk̍s to the top part resembling ϑe 囧 agony emoticon except ϑeyԙ wearing a lil hat 宀. Iṋ writing ï prefer to replace ϑ'bottom bit 咼 with a 骨 body, ⅋ut unicode for chinese characters has itꝬ limits (sometimes ï wiʃh we cůld construct characters like w/ hangul somehow).
我 iꝬ actually an ancient pictogram depicting a barrier of swords or someϑiŋ similar which iꝬ cool, ⅋ut ï find ϑ'adoption of it to use for ϑ'most common pronoun of all time as a phoneme quite uninspired. So non-bidenary of me.
