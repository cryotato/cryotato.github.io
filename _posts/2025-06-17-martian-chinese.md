# 窝/窩 - temperamental 我
ï like using 窝/窩 in place of 我 (meaning I or me) b∵c it lꙭks more like a person. w/ ϑ'simplified 窝 it lꙭks like a face with a ૮ ,◕ ﻌ ◕ა-type nose and a mustache. ϑ'traditional character 窩 can simultaneously be used to express discontent, ϑa̍ňk̍s to the top part resembling ϑe 囧 agony emoticon... just except ϑeyԙ wearing a lil hat 宀. For example:

- 窩餓死了！(ïm starving 囧)
- 窝覺得牛肉麵最好吃の~ (ï ϑink beef noodle soup tastes ϑ'best :3)
- 窩想你 (ï miss ᴜ̊ 囧)
- 窝の丈夫好可愛喔 (my husbant sou cute :3)
- 窩ゐ你瘋了 (ᴜ̊ drive me crazy 囧)
- 窝ゐ你瘋了 (ᴜ̊ drive me crazy :3)

Iṋ writing ï prefer to replace ϑ'bottom bit 咼 with a 骨 body, ⅋ut unicode for chinese characters has itꝬ limits (sometimes ï wiʃh we cůld construct characters like w/ hangul somehow). 我 iꝬ actually an ancient pictogram depicting a barrier of swords or someϑiŋ similar which iꝬ cool, ⅋ut ï find ϑ'adoption of it to use for ϑ'most common pronoun of all time as a phoneme quite uninspired. So non-bidenary of me. 窩 iꝬ already used & recognised iṋ Chinese post-irony innerweb circles, where itꝬ used phonetically as a lazier more casual sounding 我 b∵c it lacks tone. Muɕh of ŵhat ïm outlining here iꝬ an exploration of ϑose existing deterritorial frameworks like 火星文 Martian Script.

# の - possessive 的
ϑis ones a raϑer low hanging fruit since itꝬ already widely used & even legally recognised in Hong Kong. From my understanding, itꝬ used as a 草書 cursive script rendering of the bopomo character ㄉ, ⅋ut it cůld also be ϑat の in Japanese iꝬ used ϑ'same way. 的 has been on̅e of ϑ'most baffling characters to people trying to understand chinese writing logograφically. ItꝬ used 99.9% of ϑ' time as ϑ'possessive particle "de" ⅋ut b∵c it was adopted as a phoneme like 我, ϑ'character suggests it's related to l̗i̗gh̖t̖ - 白 means white and 勺 iꝬ a ladle w/ someϑiŋ iṋ it. When used as "dì" (instead of de) meaning aim or clear, ϑis makes total sense, ⅋ut oϑerwise... nøt so muɕh.

# 草書
Speaking of 草書, ϑ'only cursive script characters we ԙ able to use remain culturally exclusive to Japan ϑa̍ňk̍s to ϑeir adoption of rushed characters as hirigana. Lets make use of what we have. We can't be letting ϑem have all ϑ'fun, ï mean ゐ什麼日本人可以用草書字但是窩用の事後你們叫窩一个 traitor. 窩ふ要給窩の婆婆 ww2 flashbacks 但是やふ窩の錯 technology killed ϑ'whimsy out of writing. Ahem.. Anyway, ϑere are plenty (& even more if ᴜ̊ count ϑ'unicodes for hentaigana) ⅋ut ϑese seem to be ϑ'most legible:

- ゐ - 為
- ふ - 不
- わ - 和
- や - 也 (personally helps me distinguish between 也 & 世)
- も - 毛 (distinguish twix 毛 & 手)

# Alternative Characters
ï also have a soft spot for certain variations of characters. On̅e example would be 髙 for 高 meaning high, b∵c it has a ladder.
