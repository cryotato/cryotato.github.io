title: post-pessimism

is it normal to have obsessively fantasized about having been aborted as a fetus in your teenage years? i cursed my mum for giving birth to me,. now such a thing seems almost unthinkable. i wonder what changed. i used to be a stubborn antinatalist and was convinced life could only ever be painful and tragic and that happiness itself is only teasing a much greater disappointment etc,, or that even worse - nothing meant anything and it was all just a drag and the only reason i didn't just kill myself was because i thought that would be equally pointless and terrifying knowing i was going to die anyway. i was wrong. not because of any lapse in logic but because i had projected my terrible circumstances onto the nature of being,, a cold lifeless environment had been normalized by everyone around me. i was told that i was the problem repeatedly, that i had no right to be depressed, i hadnt tried hard enough to like it, hadn't seen enough of this world yet,[^1] etc. i remember my dad, upon discovering my misery, condemned my distain for life, telling me ïm in my golden years and that life was only ever going to go downhill from here, and all i ever dared to ask was "wait... if this is it then whats the point?"

ŵꝬ ϑ'meaning of life? ïm in a lucky enůgh position to find such a question pointless now, to recognize ϑat ϑere can never be a satisfying answer to ϑis question., not b∵c life is meaningless, ⅋ut b∵c every abstract aspect of life is an artform. ꝡ do ᴜ̊ like ϑ'art you choose to engage wiϑ? ꝡ do ᴜ̊ find meaning in ϑat? ꝡ do ᴜ̊ l𖹭ve? do ᴜ̊ find ϑ'same abstract meaninglessness iṋ a l𖹭ver's smile? iṋ a kisƨ? ŵ about ϑ'trees ϑat need ϑ'wind to blow ϑrů? iṋ ϑ'weight, ϑ'vastness of clouds? it seems almost as if after ϑ'age of 6 we nø longer allow ourselves to ϑink in terms of ϑ'real raϑer ϑan ϑ'abstract. iṋ terms of math & capital. ŵ iꝬ it ϑat a child understands ϑat we cannot?
