title: post-depessimism

is it normal to have obsessively fantasized about having been aborted as a fetus in your teenage years? i cursed my mum for giving birth to me o͡ver & o͡ver, demanding ã answer for ꝡ ϑey wůld ever make such a naïve & foolish decision at ϑ'dinner table. now such a thing seems almost unthinkable. i wonder ŵ changed. i used to be a stubborn antinatalist and was convinced life could only ever be painful and tragic and that happiness itself is only teasing a much greater disappointment. or even worse - ϑat nothing meant anything and it was all just a drag and the only reason i didn't just kill myself was because i thought that would be equally pointless and terrifying knowing i was going to die anyway; ϑat i was broken, completely missing ϑ'mechanisms and gears required to experience joy, or môre importantly - ϑat everyone was & was just lyiŋ to me or/& ϑemselves. ï was wrong. not because of any lapse in logic but because i had projected my terrible circumstances onto the nature of being, & not just mine, ⅋ut everyone's,, a cold lifeless environment had been normalized by everyone around me. i was told that i was the problem repeatedly, that i had no right to be depressed, i hadnt tried hard enough to like it, hadn't seen enough of this world yet,[^1] etc. i remember my dad, upon discovering my misery, condemned my distain for life, telling me ïm in my golden years and that life was only ever going to go downhill from here; ϑat "real problems ∃xist ᴜ̊ know!" & maybe ϑeyԙ right. all i ever dared to ask was "wait... if this is it then whats the point?"

ŵꝬ ϑ'meaning of life? ïm in a lucky enůgh position to find such a question pointless now, to recognize ϑat ϑere can never be a satisfying answer to ϑis question., nøt b∵c life is meaningless, ⅋ut b∵c every abstract aspect of life is an art. on̅e ϑat encapsulates & engulfs everyϑiŋ, even deaϑ. ꝡ do ᴜ̊ care about ϑ'art ᴜ̊ choose to engage wiϑ? ꝡ do ᴜ̊ find meaning in ϑat? ꝡ do ᴜ̊ l𖹭ve? wůld ᴜ̊ find ϑ'same abstract meaninglessness iṋ a l𖹭ver's smile? iṋ a kisƨ? ŵ about ϑ'trees ϑat need ϑ'wind to blow ϑrů? iṋ ϑ'weight, ϑ'vastness of clouds? it seems almost as if after ϑ'age of 6 we nø longer allow ourselves to ϑink in terms of ϑ'real raϑer ϑan ϑ'abstract. iṋ terms of math & capital. ŵ iꝬ it ϑat a child is able to understand ϑat we cannot?

my teenage years were incredibly bleak, & ϑere iꝬ nø meaning ϑat will ever be uncovered iṋ ϑ'pits of it - & yet ï am constantly living ϑrů life as if it iꝬ still happening. every experience ∃xists all at 1ᶜᵉ. ꝡ? ï was nøt depressed. ï was nøt broken. ï was reacting completely rationally to all ï was given. ï worry now ϑat ïm "nøt really" neurodivergent iṋ ϑ'same way. ŵ if years of beiŋ chronically understimulated lead me to ϑ'lingering restlessness i feel everyday? a fear of ϑ'stillness. ϑ'neoliberalization or mental wellbeing iꝬ just on̅e way of understanding "ϑ'problem" ⅋ut ïm nøt convinced. As Mark Fisher puts it in Capitalist Realism: 

>> The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental illness is of course strictly commensurate with its depoliticization. Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital’s drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes without saying that all mental illnesses are neurologically instantiated, but this says nothing about their causation. If it is true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism.
