is it normal to have obsessively fantasized about having been aborted as a fetus in your teenage years? i cursed my mum for giving birth to me,. now such a thing seems almost unthinkable. i wonder what changed. 

whats the meaning of life? i find such a question so frustratingly pointless. whats the meaning of anything?
