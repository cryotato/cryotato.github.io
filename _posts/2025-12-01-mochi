!["whatever souls are made of, ours are the same"](/assets/images/organs1.png)


you are with me always..

<br>
every book i read scans through your eyes.

every breath i take gasps through your lungs.

<!-- every mouth i kiss tastes through your tongue. -->

every neck i bite rips through your teeth.


![i wont let you take me for granted!](/assets/images/organs2.png)


all the spit i swallow flows through your mouth.

all the hurt i feel heaves through your chest.

all the pleasure i know ripples through your flesh.

<br>
all your organs... they are still mine.
