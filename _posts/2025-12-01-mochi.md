!["whatever souls are made of, ours are the same"](/assets/images/organs1.png)


you ԙ with me always..

<br>

every book ï read scans ϑrů your eyes.

every breath ï take gasps ϑrů your lungs.

<!-- every mouth i kiss tastes through your tongue. -->

every neck ï bite rips ϑrů your teeth.


![i wont let you take me for granted!](/assets/images/organs2.png)


all ϑ'spit ï swallow flows ϑrů your mouth.

all ϑ'hurt ï carry heaves ϑrů your chest.

all ϑ'pleasure ï know ripples ϑrů your flesh.

<br>

all your organs..

ϑeyԙ still mine!
