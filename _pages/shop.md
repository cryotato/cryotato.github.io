## The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? And what of the surgery! Once you’ve drilled into your baby, pickup positions are fixed, and fixed its personality will be until the miserable day it reaches a landfill. Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

## The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

## Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

## Emergent phenomena
This new way of interpreting vibrations opens up the door for a whole new unexplored world of ways to shape sound
### Emergent distortion
- Direct lasers above the strings give the freedom to experiment with angle and position to manipulate the sound
- Positioning them right above the strings clip the sound into a distorted squarewave-like shape
- Positioning them slightly off to the side captures more of the vibrations resulting in a more detailed sound
- Positioning them beyond the edge of the string can create a gating effect, where only loudest most aggressive strums are captured

### Emergent phasing
- Reflected lasers below the strings provide a cleaner sound and help preserve dynamics.
- Because the signal from the direct and reflected lasers are opposed, together they phase (when string is still, the direct laser is blocked from reaching the photodiode - a 0, but the reflected laser relies on the string being in place to reflect into the photodiode at all - 1)
- One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity

### Emergent compression
- Dims when loud, preserving dynamics
- Brightness of lasers communicate gain, creating an interesting pulsing visual effect
- Flashy!

### Emergent Rhythm
- MIDI or CV input can be used to gate the lasers creating rhythmic effects

## Features

### Hexaphonique
- The Hex picks up each string individually, so each string can have its own effects chain
- A single 6 string guitar transforms into an orchestra of opportunity

### Pocketability for gigs and nomads
- Mounts onto any string instrument
- Built in audio interface provides unmatched 6-channel hexaphonic versatility out a single USB, MIDI, CV output, or switchable traditional audio output configurations
- Option for pedalboard-less and DAW-focused effect chains

### Compatibility for catguts
- One for all the experimental string materials and niche instruments
- Modular and secure attachment-style

### Standby
- Lasers stay dim until it hears something

## FAQ:
### Is there a warranty?
Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective pickup, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. Full legalese warranty will be posted later.

### You shouldn’t get one if…
You need a perfectly polished sound. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun!
