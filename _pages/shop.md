BEND LIGHT, WARP SOUND. JOIN THE ANTI-MAGNOMUSH MOVEMENT


![LOVELESS REFERENCE](/assets/images/artifactlovelesshex.jpeg)

# The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

# The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

# Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

# Emergent phenomena
You open the door, to another door, to another door. In this unexplored territory, machines are weaponized against familiarity.

> [emergence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergence) /ɪˈmɜː.dʒəns/ (noun)

> the development of particular patterns, properties, or behaviours in parts of complex systems that happen only when the parts of the system interact, and that the parts do not have on their own.


## Emergent distortion

*   Total eclipse - Above :: With rays directly overhead, shadows harden and vibrations slam against sensor thresholds. The signal is clipped - decapitated into synthetic limit-cased square-wave screaming.
*   Partial eclipse - Displacement :: Offset rays to graze the string-shadow from the Total to surgically target micro-variations. 
*   First contact - beyond the Periphery :: Stray far enough & rays shine unobstructed, skimming the string’s oscillating perimeter. Silence reigns, punctured only by violent strums breaching the sensor field.


## Emergent phasing

*   Full moon - Sub-String :: Light scatters from a second sun on the underside. String presence gates photon return, & so the string-shadow binary is flipped. Compared to the overexposed readings from the sun, a cleaner wave can be extracted from the secondary reflections of the moon.
*   Moonlight Eclipse cancellation :: Binary opposition is hardwired. Signals are intrinsically phase-opposed by nature. Polarity itself becomes the signal, blending & folding themselves onto each other

above : blocked : zero.

below : reflected : one.


*   Phase Diversity :: Dual-Point Capture :: One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity, blending two tones together

## Emergent compression
*   Loudness -> Dimness - Preservation :: Amplitude spikes trigger systemic dampening modulated at its source. A new and completely unique method of downwards compression, not by algorithm, but by using analogue audio-visual feedback. Everything is a reference to itself.
*   Breathing - Pulsation :: Flashy! --> the visuality of the system policing its own intensity levels allows the mechanism itself to be immediately understood. Seeing is believing. 

## Emergent rhythm
*   MIDI/CV Injected gating :: External clock signals interrupt laser emitters, inter-process sidechaining - imposed rhythm.
- MIDI Dejected Symphony :: Pitch detection turns the Hex into a moderator of MIDI chaos for external synths to feed.


# Hexaphonics?
A single guitar unfolds into 6 - an orchestra. String peaks themselves become living knobs, allowing for vast unprecedented sonique-freedom

> hexaphonic /ˌhɛksəˈfɒnɪk/ (adjective)
>(of sound reproduction) In six channels.

<!-- - The Hex picks up each string individually, so each string can have its own effects chain
- A single 6 string guitar transforms into an orchestra of opportunity
- peaks of each string interpreted as knobs

Here are just a few ideas for how this feature could be used:


## Resonance 
Since each string's sensor is independent, you could digitally route the amplitude of one string's signal as any other knob to modulate an effect on another string. This creates artificial sympathetic resonance effects or complex internal modulation textures impossible with mono pickups.

## Spatialization
You can pan each string to a unique position in the stereo field, resulting in a very wide and immersive sound. For instance, low E panned far left and high E far right, with other strings in between.

## Pseudo-12-String

You could shift the pitch of each string individually to effectively create microtonal tunings in real-time, or layer octaves/fifths for each string to get a 12-string-like effect. -->

## Impliques & possibilities
### Artificial Resonance
Reconstruct strings together, for one to digitally ignite effects on another. Play god and wire your guitars sympathetic nervous system. Make it meow. :3
### Landscape Architecture
Pan and explode the each string outwards to its own coordinates within stereo-space. Strategize constructed confields[^1]. Hyper-Spatialization.
### Pseudo-12-Stringification
Pitch-bend per-string for instant microtonal detunings, or stacked octaves and harmonies for infinite-string density. Forge new instruments from light.

<!-- # What if we created a Body without Organs?
How do these machines interact to create a BwO? Everything is a reference to itself.,

# Body
All this packed in a single compact package. No split boxes. No 16 channel XLR audio interfaces. No propritary trip hazards. No compromise. Just one wire out USB, with switchable traditional analog output configurations if you change your mind.

## Pocketability for gigs and nomads
- Built in audio interface provides unmatched 6-channel hexaphonic versatility out a single USB, or switchable traditional audio output configurations (traditional mono all signals go into one, all strings into one stereo jack with 3 strings on left and right, fully hexaphonic through 3 stereo jacks)
- Option for pedalboard-less and DAW-focused effect chains

# Compatibility for catguts
- One for all the experimental string materials and niche instruments
- Modular and secure attachment-style

# What do these cool people think?
> yeah man this thing rocks -- person.


# I want one!

# FAQ:
## Will there be warranty?
Yes – we cover manufacturing defects for 30 days from the date you receive your order. Just send the defective pickup back to us, and once it arrives, we’ll ship you a replacement at no extra cost. The full legal warranty will be posted soon.

## You shouldn’t get one if…
You’re after a flawlessly polished, mass-produced product. This is a labour of love, not a startup chasing scale. Expect a few rough edges (literally). Delays may happen. Some features won’t be ready at launch. Things might break, or not last as long as you’d hope. The only thing we can promise? It’ll be awesome – and a whole lot of fun.
