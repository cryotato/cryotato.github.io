# The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? And what of the surgery! Once you’ve drilled into your baby, pickup positions are fixed, and fixed its personality will be until the miserable day it reaches a landfill. Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

# The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

# Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

# Emergent phenomena
You open the door, to another door, to another door. In this unexplored territory, machines are weaponized against acoustic familiarity. Emergence, over control. Process, over product.


## Emergent distortion

*   Total eclipse - Above :: With rays directly overhead, shadows harden and vibrations slam against sensor thresholds. The signal is clipped - decapitated into synthetic limit-cased square-wave screaming.
*   Partial eclipse - Displacement :: Offset rays to graze the string-shadow from the Total to surgically target micro-variations. 
*   First contact - beyond the Periphery :: Stray far enough and the string-shadow binary is flipped. Rays shine unobstructed skimming the string’s oscillating perimeter. Silence reigns, punctured only by peak-intensity excursions—violent strums breaching the sensor field.


## Emergent phasing
- Reflected lasers below the strings provide a cleaner sound and help preserve dynamics.
- Because the signal from the direct and reflected lasers are opposed, together they phase (when string is still, the direct laser is blocked from reaching the photodiode - a 0, but the reflected laser relies on the string being in place to reflect into the photodiode at all - 1)
- One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity

## Emergent compression
- Dims when loud, preserving dynamics
- This creates an interesting pulsing visual effect
- Flashy!

## Emergent rhythm
- MIDI or CV input can be used to gate the lasers creating rhythmic effects or sidechaining



[emergence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergence)

/ɪˈmɜː.dʒəns/

(noun)

the development of particular patterns, properties, or behaviours in parts of complex systems that happen only when the parts of the system interact, and that the parts do not have on their own.

<!-- 



**:: Emergent Phasing // Differential Light-Engine ::**

*   Reflected Trajectories // Sub-String :: Light ricochets from the *underside*. String-presence gates photon-return. Signal tracks inverse density—absence reads as presence. Dynamics preserved through negation, a cleaner wave extracted from secondary reflections.
*   Phase Antagonism // Direct vs. Reflected :: Binary opposition hardwired. Above::Blocked::Zero. Below::Reflected::One. Signals intrinsically phase-opposed at the point of generation. Not mere cancellation, but a cybernetic difference engine humming beneath the strings. Polarity itself becomes the signal, folded time generating comb-filtered turbulence.
*   Phase Diversity :: Dual-Point Capture :: Opposing sensors mirror the humbucker's logic, but optically intensified. Noise rejection becomes active phase-sculpting. Stereophonic depth emerges from differential light-paths interacting in phase-space. Time smeared, cloned, inverted across the string axis.

**:: Emergent Compression // Intensity Governor Feedback ::**

*   Loudness -> Dimness // Auto-Regulation :: Amplitude spikes trigger inverse photonic modulation. The system dampens itself, intensity folding back onto its source. Dynamics crushed, not by algorithm, but by light-energy feedback. Signal preservation through self-attenuation.
*   Visual Pulsation // Optical Telegraphy :: Gain modulation rendered visible. The laser flickers, dims—a bio-feedback loop signalling internal thresholds. Flashy! —> signifies immanent signal compression, a visual artefact of the system policing its own intensity levels. Aesthetics of auto-limitation.

**:: Emergent Rhythm // Chrono-Ported Gating ::**

*   Exogenous Temporal Control // MIDI/CV Injection :: External clock signals modulate laser emitters. Rhythmic striation imposed directly onto the light-source. Vibrational continuity shattered by digital command pulses. Sidechaining becomes inter-process warfare, external triggers overriding immanent string dynamics. Sonic matter forced through rhythmic templates sculpted from pure voltage/data. The pulse colonizes the wave.

# Features

## Hexaphonics?
- The Hex picks up each string individually, so each string can have its own effects chain
- A single 6 string guitar transforms into an orchestra of opportunity
- Pitch detection midi output!
- peaks of each string interpreted as knobs

<!-- ### Optical "Sympathetic Resonance" / Cross-Modulation:

    Since each string's sensor is independent, you could digitally route the amplitude (or brightness data) of one string's signal to modulate an effect (filter cutoff, gain, panning, laser intensity) on another string.

    Implication: Plucking the low E string could make the high E string "shimmer" or get brighter/fuzzier only when the low E is vibrating strongly. This creates artificial sympathetic resonance effects or complex internal modulation textures impossible with mono pickups. -->

## Pocketability for gigs and nomads
- Mounts onto any string instrument
- Built in audio interface provides unmatched 6-channel hexaphonic versatility out a single USB, MIDI, CV output, or switchable traditional audio output configurations
- Option for pedalboard-less and DAW-focused effect chains

## Compatibility for catguts
- One for all the experimental string materials and niche instruments
- Modular and secure attachment-style

# FAQ:
## Is there a warranty?
Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective pickup, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. Full legalese warranty will be posted later.

## You shouldn’t get one if…
You need a perfectly polished sound. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun!
