# The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? And what of the surgery! Once you’ve drilled into your baby, pickup positions are fixed, and fixed its personality will be until the miserable day it reaches a landfill. Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

# The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

# Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

**The Chad Hexaphonic Laser Pickup**

*   **LASER PRECISION:** Sees vibration with pure light. Reads *each* string individually like a god.
*   **UNIVERSAL DOMINANCE:** Doesn't care if strings are metal, nylon, or your mom's rubber bands. It just *works*.
*   **EMERGENCE! INVITES CHAOS:** Physics itself creates distortion, phasing, compression. Bend light, bend reality. Total sonic control AND happy accidents.
*   **SIX CHANNELS OF POWER:** Unleashes a per-string orchestra. Individual FX chains? MIDI/CV output per string? Effortless.
*   **STREAMLINED ASCENSION:** Direct digital/CV/MIDI output potential via a single pathway. Clean. Elegant. Future.
*   **NEO-FEEDBACK MACHINE:** Everything is a reference to itself. Ouroboros energy. Complete. Global. SATURATION.

**The Cringe Incel Traditional / Legacy Pickups**

*   **MONOPHONIC MUD:** Squeezes 6 strings into one flat, homogenized signal. Limits texture, potential crushed. So basic.
*   **MAGNETIC RIGIDITY:** Cries if strings aren't metal. Rejects nylon players. Stuck in the past.
*   **HEX COPE:** Abandoned 70s tech, tacky MIDI focus. OR requires proprietary cables, expensive breakout boxes ($$$$), complex hacks. "Premium audio solution" my ass. Clinical bulk.
*   **OPTICAL OBLIVION:** Rare, expensive *whole guitars*, maybe picks up strums wrong? Still not truly hexaphonic. Niche dead end.
*   **CABLE LABYRINTH:** Needs external interfaces, splitters, converters just to *pretend* it has Chad's flexibility. Pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream.
*   **STALINIST RIGIDITY:** Fears innovation. Clings to "iconic tone" because it has nothing else. Boo! Let us play!

<!-- 

**THE VIRGIN TRADITIONAL / EXISTING PICKUPS**

*   **Incel Magnetic:** Squeezes all strings into one flat, boring signal. Can ONLY see metal strings. Rejected nylon. Stalinist rigidity.
*   **Awkward Existing Hex:** Needs expensive ($400+) proprietary breakout boxes & special DIN cables. Complicated, abandoned tech from the 70s trying to cosplay as MIDI. Still requires *more* boxes for CV/Synth stuff.
*   **Beta Optical:** Rare, weak signal from the side? Never even *tried* hexaphonic output. Basically a science project someone forgot about.
*   Requires a **LABYRINTH** of cables, interfaces ($200-$700+!), and converters just to *maybe* touch a synth. Clinical bulk.
*   Stuck in the past, selling "physicality" and "novelty" because practicality left long ago. Homogenized, predictable sound.

**THE CHAD HEXAPHONIC LASER PICKUP**

*   **Untangles strings:** 6 individual signals of pure data. Laser precision sees EVERYTHING: metal, nylon, rubber bands, whispers of the void.
*   **Direct Output Power:** ONE cable for USB, MIDI, or CV. Plugs straight into DAW or modular. No extra boxes needed.
*   **Invites CHAOS & EMERGENCE:** Bends physics for real-time, analog-source distortion, phasing, compression by playing with light and shadow. Whimsy!
*   **Orchestra of Opportunity:** Per-string FX chains, pitch-to-MIDI/CV *built-in*. Guitar becomes a synth controller AND sound design weapon.
*   **Neo-Feedback Machine:** Bridges analog feel and digital destruction. Everything is a reference to itself. Unlocks unexplored territory. Future is NOW.

# Emergent phenomena
You open the door, to another door, to another door. In this unexplored territory, machines are weaponized against acoustic familiarity. Emergence, over control. Everything is a reference to itself.

> [emergence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergence) /ɪˈmɜː.dʒəns/ (noun)

> the development of particular patterns, properties, or behaviours in parts of complex systems that happen only when the parts of the system interact, and that the parts do not have on their own.


## Emergent distortion

*   Total eclipse - Above :: With rays directly overhead, shadows harden and vibrations slam against sensor thresholds. The signal is clipped - decapitated into synthetic limit-cased square-wave screaming.
*   Partial eclipse - Displacement :: Offset rays to graze the string-shadow from the Total to surgically target micro-variations. 
*   First contact - beyond the Periphery :: Stray far enough & rays shine unobstructed, skimming the string’s oscillating perimeter. Silence reigns, punctured only by violent strums breaching the sensor field.


## Emergent phasing

*   Full moon - Sub-String :: Light scatters from a second sun on the underside. String presence gates photon return, & so the string-shadow binary is flipped. Compared to the overexposed readings from the sun, a cleaner wave can be extracted from the secondary reflections of the moon.
*   Moonlight Eclipse cancellation :: Binary opposition is hardwired. Signals are intrinsically phase-opposed by nature. Polarity itself becomes the signal, blending & folding themselves onto each other

above : blocked : zero.

below : reflected : one.


*   Phase Diversity :: Dual-Point Capture :: One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity, blending two tones together

## Emergent compression
*   Loudness -> Dimness - Preservation :: Amplitude spikes trigger systemic dampening modulated at its source. A new and completely unique method of downwards compression, not by algorithm, but by using analogue audio-visual feedback. Everything is a reference to itself.
*   Breathing - Pulsation :: Flashy! --> the visuality of the system policing its own intensity levels allows the mechanism itself to be immediately understood. Seeing is believing. 

## Emergent rhythm
*   MIDI/CV Injected gating :: External clock signals interrupt laser emitters, inter-process sidechaining - imposed rhythm.
- MIDI Dejected Symphony :: Pitch detection turns the Hex into a moderator of MIDI chaos for external synths to feed.

# Features

## Hexaphonics?
- The Hex picks up each string individually, so each string can have its own effects chain
- A single 6 string guitar transforms into an orchestra of opportunity
- Pitch detection midi output!
- peaks of each string interpreted as knobs

<!-- ### Optical "Sympathetic Resonance" / Cross-Modulation:

    Since each string's sensor is independent, you could digitally route the amplitude (or brightness data) of one string's signal to modulate an effect (filter cutoff, gain, panning, laser intensity) on another string.

    Implication: Plucking the low E string could make the high E string "shimmer" or get brighter/fuzzier only when the low E is vibrating strongly. This creates artificial sympathetic resonance effects or complex internal modulation textures impossible with mono pickups. -->

## Pocketability for gigs and nomads
- Mounts onto any string instrument
- Built in audio interface provides unmatched 6-channel hexaphonic versatility out a single USB, MIDI, CV output, or switchable traditional audio output configurations
- Option for pedalboard-less and DAW-focused effect chains

## Compatibility for catguts
- One for all the experimental string materials and niche instruments
- Modular and secure attachment-style

# FAQ:
## Is there a warranty?
Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective pickup, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. Full legalese warranty will be posted later.

## You shouldn’t get one if…
You need a perfectly polished sound. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun!
