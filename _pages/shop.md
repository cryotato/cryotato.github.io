# The claustrophobia, the clinical bulk.
“Premium audio solutions”. By squeezing all the strings into a flat homogenized signal, conventional guitar pickups limit possibilities for texture. I’m not trying to be cute when I say existing setups to fix this require a labyrinth of cables, it’s a pointlessly proprietary overpriced fever dream - not to mention the external interfaces, splitters, and complex MIDI or CV converters they expect of you. All the while traditional magnetic systems reject nylon or unconventional instruments entirely. Stalinist rigidity? And what of the surgery! Once you’ve drilled into your baby, pickup positions are fixed, and fixed its personality will be until the miserable day it reaches a landfill. Boo! What about those of us that want to play? 

# The prescription? Invite chaos!
Emergence! By untangling and picking up each string separately we can knit them into new warm blankets of noise with per-string FX processing – powered and contained neatly in DAWs or modular synths via a single USB, CV, or MIDI output. It’s literal laser precision allows you to pick at the sands and grit, while the clip-on design introduces the flexibility to terrain through soundscapes and explore different tones along any type of string without mods or surgery.

# Huh? Lasers?
Picture this. A laser pointer shines a beam of light at your guitar string. Right below, there’s a light sensor. When you pluck the string, it vibrates—blocking some of the laser beam as it moves. The sensor sees these changes in brightness and turns those flickers into electrical signals... Data! Sound! Everything you’ve ever heard is a vibration. 1s and 0s fossilize it. Onses and offses. Flickering. The way that it works is almost indistinguishable from a microphone, but instead of picking up vibrations in the air, it sees them with light.

Light doesn’t c­are if your strings are metal, nylon, or rubber bands—it works on anything that moves. Slide the pickup closer to the guitar’s body for warm, mellow tones, or near the neck for bright, twangy sounds. Feeling restless? Experiment with the lasers to make the sensors misread the light flickers, creating glitches, distortion, or warbles, all with nothing but physics. Whimsy! Take me away!

Chad Laser Pickup:

    Literally sees vibrations.

    Empowers each string and respects their individuality 

    Inclusive King; works with ANY string material (nylon, steel, catgut, doesn't care).

    Handles everything effortlessly via USB without middlemen

    Polyglot; speaks CV, and analogue on top of DAW friendly USB

    rhizomatic rizz. defies convention

    whimsy

    Affordable and open source, not afraid to share.

    afraid of the future

    Forces strings into a single homogenized signal; demands conformity, 

    may be a little overweight
    
    "it's easy to hate the rich, but do you have the courage to hate the poor?"

    probably racist, only works with specific metal strings

    proprietary; possessive, insecure, and controlling - refuses to co-operate with your friends

    Rigidly fixed in one position; zero adaptability, complains when things change.

    Often gatekeeps with high prices or complex, abandoned systems; whines about why nobody adopted it.

# Emergent phenomena
You open the door, to another door, to another door. In this unexplored territory, machines are weaponized against acoustic familiarity. Emergence, over control. Everything is a reference to itself.

> [emergence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergence) /ɪˈmɜː.dʒəns/ (noun)

> the development of particular patterns, properties, or behaviours in parts of complex systems that happen only when the parts of the system interact, and that the parts do not have on their own.


## Emergent distortion

*   Total eclipse - Above :: With rays directly overhead, shadows harden and vibrations slam against sensor thresholds. The signal is clipped - decapitated into synthetic limit-cased square-wave screaming.
*   Partial eclipse - Displacement :: Offset rays to graze the string-shadow from the Total to surgically target micro-variations. 
*   First contact - beyond the Periphery :: Stray far enough & rays shine unobstructed, skimming the string’s oscillating perimeter. Silence reigns, punctured only by violent strums breaching the sensor field.


## Emergent phasing

*   Full moon - Sub-String :: Light scatters from a second sun on the underside. String presence gates photon return, & so the string-shadow binary is flipped. Compared to the overexposed readings from the sun, a cleaner wave can be extracted from the secondary reflections of the moon.
*   Moonlight Eclipse cancellation :: Binary opposition is hardwired. Signals are intrinsically phase-opposed by nature. Polarity itself becomes the signal, blending & folding themselves onto each other

above : blocked : zero.

below : reflected : one.


*   Phase Diversity :: Dual-Point Capture :: One of these per side create a humbucker-like phase diversity, blending two tones together

## Emergent compression
*   Loudness -> Dimness - Preservation :: Amplitude spikes trigger systemic dampening modulated at its source. A new and completely unique method of downwards compression, not by algorithm, but by using analogue audio-visual feedback. Everything is a reference to itself.
*   Breathing - Pulsation :: Flashy! --> the visuality of the system policing its own intensity levels allows the mechanism itself to be immediately understood. Seeing is believing. 

## Emergent rhythm
*   MIDI/CV Injected gating :: External clock signals interrupt laser emitters, inter-process sidechaining - imposed rhythm.
- MIDI Dejected Symphony :: Pitch detection turns the Hex into a moderator of MIDI chaos for external synths to feed.

# Hexaphonics?

hexaphonic
/ˌhɛksəˈfɒnɪk/
(of sound reproduction) In six channels.

- The Hex picks up each string individually, so each string can have its own effects chain
- A single 6 string guitar transforms into an orchestra of opportunity
- Pitch detection midi output!
- peaks of each string interpreted as knobs

Here are just a few ideas for how this feature could be used:

## Resonance 
Since each string's sensor is independent, you could digitally route the amplitude (or brightness data) of one string's signal to modulate an effect (filter cutoff, gain, panning, laser intensity) on another string.

Implication: Plucking the low E string could make the high E string "shimmer" or get brighter/fuzzier only when the low E is vibrating strongly. This creates artificial sympathetic resonance effects or complex internal modulation textures impossible with mono pickups.

## Spatialization
Wide Stereo Spread: You can pan each string to a unique position in the stereo field, resulting in a very wide and immersive sound. For instance, low E panned far left and high E far right, with other strings in between.

3D Spatialization: Using ambisonics or surround sound setups, you could place each string in a specific location in 3D space, giving a new dimensionality to the guitar sound.

Moving Strings: Automate panning so that the sound of individual strings moves around the stereo or surround field dynamically. Each string could "travel" as you play.

## Instant guitar retuning / Pitch Shifting

Per-String Pitch Shifting: You could shift the pitch of each string individually, effectively creating custom tunings in real-time. For instance, while playing in standard tuning, pitch shift the B and high E strings up by a few semitones for an instant open tuning effect.

Harmonizers: Use harmonizing effects on certain strings. For example, you could add fifths or octaves only to specific strings, giving the appearance of multiple guitar parts being played simultaneously.

Octave Splitting: Octave pedals could be applied only to lower strings to fatten up the bass range while keeping the higher strings unaffected for clearer melodies.






# Pocketability for gigs and nomads
- Mounts onto any string instrument
- Built in audio interface provides unmatched 6-channel hexaphonic versatility out a single USB, MIDI, CV output, or switchable traditional audio output configurations
- Option for pedalboard-less and DAW-focused effect chains

# Compatibility for catguts
- One for all the experimental string materials and niche instruments
- Modular and secure attachment-style

# What do these cool people think?

# FAQ:
## Is there a warranty?
Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective pickup, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. Full legalese warranty will be posted later.

## You shouldn’t get one if…
You need a perfectly polished sound. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun!
