title: Signifier

---

The D&G quote of the day is:

> The magic triangle with its three sides—voice-audition, graphism-body, eye-pain—thus seems to us to be an order of connotation, a system of cruelty where the word has an essentially designating function, but where the graphism itself constitutes a sign in conjunction with the thing designated, and where the eye goes from one to the other, extracting and measuring the visibility of the one against the pain of the other.

i think its just kind of a deconstruction of orthography in that each process involved in creating a writing system is kind of in conflict with each other. earlier he talks about the development of phonetic symbols and how it requires two seperate cultures / languages for one to meet up and misinterpret them because its easier to communicate a symbol as a sound than a concept,,. i think this is a really arbitrary assumption but its still fun to think about and it made me think about chinese picographic writing eventually creating japanese hirigana etc., in that its original symbolic meanings are lost. chinese characters seem to be the only modern exception to this but even several components are used phonetically and are certifiably a complete fucking nightmare.. in fact i created an entire seperate hybrid chinese writing system to deal with this problem.

"alphabetical writing is not for illiterates, but by illiterates" doesnt sound like it makes sense but it does seem to actually happen, like with 女書 (girl writing) which emerged at a time when women were blocked off from education so they created their own writing system that was phonetic based on chinese characters

The signifier (phonetic abstractions of symbols) "overcoding" the signified (pictographic representations of concepts, which i think they think is more real or true somehow) is just described as "imperial" or like violent structuralist arbitrary rule-making and is actually stupid and gay and creates this kind of atmosphere where the meaning of a fundamentally meaningless string of letters is policed? like by law? only to be redirected to the original "signified" (the actual concept)., which now in extension has become an "empty tomb". It's just as easy to argue that writing can never be a real representation of anything and language through speech is more natural and has been around for much longer and is a core part of what makes us human, and so phonetic characters are not any more arbitrary than pictographic writing outside of their made up concept of what graphism is lol. but i think what they care about is moving away from representation entirely to a model of "production". like with chinese characters there are ones that "produce" its represented effect - there are a lot especially ones with the 心 heart component. 忘 (forget/neglect) has the component meaning "lost" above it, 忍 (endure/hard-heartedness) has a blade's edge, 愁 sorrow has autumn, 秋 autumn itself being a combination of a crop and a fire -- they are images that produce or conjure up thought directly. outside of chinese characters, i think emojis are a decent foil to understand the concept by,, as in the emoji doesnt require a cultural authority to be understood, it just is., universally, and so it is able to transcend a single culture or state, as long as it is intuitive or legible enough. chinese characters do the same in a more abstract form which is why so many countries used to use classical chinese to communicate with each other and write despite their languages coming from completely different language families
