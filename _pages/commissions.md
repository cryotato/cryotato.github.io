> What I have in mind is about 40 seconds of rising tension building to a beat drop when I cut to titles [...] For the beat drop I think something similar to the track you made called "siegfried fantasie (envy II)" would be perfect. I really love the ominous sense of tension here, and those bass hits and hi-hats were fun to edit around (I used this track for the social media preview of Envy). I also love that alarm bell(?) type sound at 2:17. Something like would be great for the fan thwoorp before the cut to titles. [...] I've been looking for a kind of priestly chanting that could be used as a sample for this track, and I found a recording of a Syriac chant from 1931 that's in the public domain so we can use it however we want. - Natalie

> So, I want to use the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem for this track. There's a creative commons recording, which I used in my video "Voting." [...] I'm thinking this could be title music for this video, echoing the "Ach Wie Fluchtig" remix you did for Opulence. I think a trap beat would work well for Lacrimosa too. There's a couple trap remixes on YouTube already but they're a little idk... basic? I really like those bell sounds you used on the Opulence track... but anyway I don't want to restrict you too much, I'll let you play around with it! - Natalie

> The video's theme music will be George Philipp Telemann's Ach wie nichtig ach wie flüchtig. We were hoping you'd be interested to work with us again! Natalie and I were really impressed with your house track, and a bunch of viewers were asking where they can find the track. We were hoping you could sample the clip for a OVXX-style track, but with a class hip-hop trap beat. Our idea is to merge the opulence of Baroque music, with the opulence of hip-hop/trap music. - Theryn

A track that was part of my EP "how to try" called "meowth muh nuggeth" just so happened to fit the aesthetic of the "digital messiah"

 My music has also been featured in various makeup vlogs by okaysage. Much of my earlier work should only ever be listened to hauntologically - otherwise I find it a little embarrassing

### Others
Okay so this one is seriously incredibly bizarre but a lot of attention I got early on when I first started making tunes as a literal 13 year old came directly from [this vlog of Gle Marquez](https://youtu.be/wQ5AepXgHCs?si=2OTDyhyU-GTP6oOC&t=1199) talking about how her boyfriend died in an accident

### Self-released as OVXX
I make tunes just for The Culture too. Here's my most recent album

## Pricing
Note that while this is just a general guideline, I'm willing to give considerable discounts to passion projects by indie artists with less income, mostly depending on if I find it personally interesting. Otherwise, an hourly rate allows flexiblity in scope and complexity, revisions, etc no matter the task at hand, and keeps commissions open for any budget. You can expect simplier projects like those involving minimalistic ambient background music, loops, sound design, or mixing/mastering existing work, to take a lot less time (~2-6 hours) than if you were to commission a full soundtrack from scratch (~7-15 hours). Any pre-made material for me to work with such as samples or motifs can be expected to take less time as well. Feel free to contact me with details of what you're looking for and I'll be able to give you a price estimate. You can also book in a call with me to watch and give input as I do cook up tunes in real time! This way you will be able to steer the ship towards whatever you're looking for.

**Base Rate** - $30 *per hour spent on project*

**Real-Time Collaboration** - $50 *per hour on call*

- **Accelerated Delivery** (+25%)  
  *(For projects requiring completion within 7 days)*
- **Exclusive Licensing** (+50%)  
  *(Client retains full rights, music will not be distributed by me under the name "OVXX")*

### Budget Capping System
Clients may specify maximum investment thresholds. Work will:
1. Proceed until cap is reached
2. Automatically pause at threshold
3. Deliver current render + progress report
4. Offer continuation options (if desired)


### Payments?
50% deposit to start, remainder before final delivery. I predominantly use PayPal but they're dicks so I'm open to using ETH or XMR if you're that kinda freak :P
