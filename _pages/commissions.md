My most popular work happens to be music commissioned by ContraPoints - which was used anywhere from title sequences to background music.

This was not a commission, a track that was part of my EP "how to try" called "meowth muh nuggeth" just so happened to fit the aesthetic of the "digital messiah"

## Pricing
Note that while this is just a general guideline, I'm willing to give considerable discounts to passion projects by indie artists with less income, mostly depending on if I find it personally interesting and if there will be a sizable audience. Otherwise, an hourly rate allows flexiblity in scope and complexity, revisions, etc no matter the task at hand, and keeps commissions open for any budget. You can expect simplier projects like those involving minimalistic ambient background music, loops, sound design, or mixing/mastering existing work, to take a lot less time (~2-6 hours) than if you were to commission a full soundtrack from scratch (~7-15 hours). Any pre-made material for me to work with such as samples or motifs can be expected to take less time as well. Feel free to contact me with details of what you're looking for and I'll be able to give you a price estimate. You can also book in a call with me to watch and give input as I do cook up tunes in real time! This way you will be able to steer the ship towards whatever you're looking for.

**Base Rate** - $25 *per hour spent on project*

**Real-Time Collaboration** - $45 *per hour on call*

- **Accelerated Delivery** (+25%)  
  *(For projects requiring completion within 7 days)*
- **Exclusive Licensing** (+50%)  
  *(Client retains full rights, music will not be distributed by me under the name "OVXX")*

### Budget Capping System
Clients may specify maximum investment thresholds. Work will:
1. Proceed until cap is reached
2. Automatically pause at threshold
3. Deliver current render + progress report
4. Offer continuation options (if desired)


### Payments?
50% deposit to start, remainder before final delivery. I predominantly use PayPal but they're dicks so I'm open to using ETH or XMR if you're a freak.
