# Pricing
Note that while this is the general guideline, I'm willing to give considerable discounts to passion projects by indie artists with less income, mostly depending on if I find it personally interesting and if there will be a sizable audience. Otherwise, an hourly rate allows flexiblity in scope and complexity, revisions, etc no matter the task at hand, and keeps commissions open for any budget. You can expect simplier projects like those involving minimalistic ambient background music, loops, sound design, or mixing/mastering existing work, to take a lot less time (~2-6 hours) than if you were to commission a full soundtrack from scratch (~7-15 hours). Any pre-made material for me to work with such as samples or moteifs can be expected to take less time as well.

### Base Rates

**Standard Production**     - $20/hour    
**Real-Time Collaboration** - $40/hour on call

### Rate Modifiers
Applicable percentage adjustments to base rate:
- **Accelerated Delivery** (+25%)  
  *(For projects requiring completion within 7 days)*
- **Exclusive Licensing** (+50%)  
  *(Client retains full rights; composer cannot reuse motifs)*

### Fee Calculation Formula
**Estimated Total** = `(Hourly Rate × Project Hours) × (1 + Sum of Modifiers)`

** For example, an urgent commercial project might look something like: **  
   `($20 × 10h) × (1 + 0.25 + 0.50) = $200 × 1.75 = $350`

### Budget Capping System
Clients may specify maximum investment thresholds. Work will:
1. Proceed until cap is reached
2. Automatically pause at threshold
3. Deliver current render + progress report
4. Offer continuation options (if desired)

### Client Cost Calculator
While actual fees depend on project complexity, estimate your investment:

1. **Choose base rate**  
   [ ] Base Rate ($20/h) + Real-Time ($40/h call time)
2. **Select modifiers**  
   [ ] Rush (+25%) [ ] Exclusive (+50%)  
   [ ] From Sample (-10%) [ ] Passion (-15%)
3. **Multiply**  
   (Hourly Rate) × 15h × (1 + Modifier Sum)

   replace this with an actual like calculating thing im sure it can be done smh.

### Payments?
50% deposit to start, remainder before final delivery. I predominantly use PayPal but they're dicks so I'm open to using ETH or XMR if you're a freak.
