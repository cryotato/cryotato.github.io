commissions are currently open for music and audio related work of any kind!

# Commission work portfolio:
insert timestamped embedded contrapoints videos i've worked on

# Pricing:
Note that while this is the general guideline, I'm willing to give considerable discounts to passion projects by indie artists with less income, mostly depending on if I find it personally interesting and if there will be a sizable audience. Otherwise, an hourly rate allows flexiblity in scope and complexity, revisions, etc no matter the task at hand, and keeps commissions open for any budget. You can expect simplier projects like those involving minimalistic ambient background music, loops, sound design, or mixing/mastering existing work, to take a lot less time (~2-6 hours) than if you were to commission a full soundtrack from scratch (~7-15 hours). Any pre-made material for me to work with such as samples or moteifs can be expected to take less time as well.

### Base Rates

**Standard Production**     - $20/hour    
**Real-Time Collaboration** - $40/hour on call

## Rate Modifiers
Applicable percentage adjustments to base rate:
- **Accelerated Delivery** (+25%)  
  *(For projects requiring completion within 7 days)*
- **Exclusive Licensing** (+50%)  
  *(Client retains full rights; composer cannot reuse motifs)*
- **Sample-Based Production** (-10%)  
  *(When building from provided rhythm beds/musical motifs)*
- **Passion Project Discount** (-15%)  
  *(For artistically ambitious/non-commercial works)*

## Fee Calculation Formula
**Estimated Total** = `(Hourly Rate × Project Hours) × (1 + Sum of Modifiers)`

### Example Estimates:
1. **Rush Commercial Project**  
   `($20 × 10h) × (1 + 0.25 + 0.50) = $200 × 1.75 = $350`
   
2. **Collaborative Passion Piece**  
   `($40 × 12h) × (1 - 0.15 - 0.10) = $480 × 0.75 = $360`

## Budget Capping System
Clients may specify maximum investment thresholds. Work will:
1. Proceed until cap is reached
2. Automatically pause at threshold
3. Deliver current render + progress report
4. Offer continuation options (if desired)

## Client Cost Calculator
While actual fees depend on project complexity, estimate your investment:

1. **Choose base rate**  
   [ ] Standard ($20/h) [ ] Real-Time ($40/h)
2. **Select modifiers**  
   [ ] Rush (+25%) [ ] Exclusive (+50%)  
   [ ] From Sample (-10%) [ ] Passion (-15%)
3. **Multiply**  
   (Hourly Rate) × 15h × (1 + Modifier Sum)

*Typical project range: $140 (7h base) - $900 (15h collaborative exclusive)*
